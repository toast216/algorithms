Integers (Maybe rationals)
GMP - Gnu Multi Precision
Type mpz_t - big integer type
Three Components:
	_md_size is # of words (limbs) Use this for size as well
	_mp_d array of words (data)  Absolute Value of Integer
	_mp_alloc # of words allocated

Multiplication
Schoolbook or "Foil method"
O(mn) m,n # of words in the operands
Improvements to Multiplication
1) Karatsuba's Method

GMP:
1) Karatsuba
2) 3-way Toom
3) 4-way Toom
6) FFT

GMP GCD's
1) Small Binary GCD
2) Lehmer's Method - Euclidean quotient "depends generally on the first few
digits of the number"
Obtain Quotient usually with a single precision operation.


n a positive integer; a exists in ZZ
[a]n = { a + kn : k exists in ZZ}
There are n unique "equivalence classes";
[0]n, [1]n, ..., [n-1]n
Just write
0,1,2,...,n-1

A group (S, .) is a set S along with a binary operation(.) on S such that:
	1) For all a, b in the set S, a.b in the set (closure)
	2) There exists e in S s.t. a.e = e.a = a For all a in S (identity)
	3) For every a in the set, there exists a (b) in the set such that
	a.b = b.a = e (inverse) 
	4) There exists a,b,c in S such that a.(b.c) = (a.b).c (associative)

Ex: V^n set of n-long binary vectors
XOR is bit-wise XOR
(V^n, XOR) is a group.
1) x = (x1,x2,...,xn)
   y = (y1,y2,...,yn)
	x XOR y = (x1 XOR y1, x2 XOR y2, ..., xn XOR yn)
2) e = (0,0,0,...,0)
3) a XOR a = e
4) Follows from associativity of XOR

A group is ableian if For all a,b in S a.b = b.a
A group is finite if |s| < infinity
Define an operator on ZZn = { [0]n, [1]n,...,[n-1]n}
x in [a]n, y in [b]n
x = a+kn      y = b+ln
x+y = (a+b) + (k+l)n in [a+b]n

So, the operation [a]n + [b]n = [a+b]n is well defined. Similarly, the product
is also well define: [a]n * [b]n = [a*b]n is well defined.

ZZn along with + as defined is a finite abelian group
Proof:
	Closure: is done.
	Identity: [0]n + [a]n = [a]n = [a]n + [0]n
	Inverse: [a]n + [-a]n = [0]n = [-a]n + [a]n
	Associativity: Follows from "regular" addition
	Commutativity: Follows from "regular" addition
	Finite: Size of ZZn = n

Ex: ZZ6

+ 0 1 2 3 4 5 
0 0 1 2 3 4 5
1 1 2 3 4 5 0
2 2 3 4 5 0 1
3 3 4 5 0 1 2
4 4 5 0 1 2 3
5 5 0 1 2 3 4

Let ZZn* is the elements of ZZn that are relatively prime to n.
ZZn* = {[a]n : gcd(a,n) = 1}
Note: This is well defined b/c gcd(a+kn, n) = gcd(a,n)
Let [a]n be in ZZn*; then gcd(a,n) = 1, so there exists x and y in ZZ s.t ax+ny=1
So Ax =1(modn) CONGRUENT

Multiplicative Identity is 1 ([1]n) since [1]n*[a]n = [a]n = [a]n*[1]n
So [a]n*[x]n = [1]n So X is the inverse of a in ZZn*

ZZn* with . as defined is a finite abelian group.
