ZZ = {...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...}
NN = {0,1,2,3,....}

Divisibility:
Integers a, d. d divides a written d|a if a = dk, k <- ZZ
"a is a multiple of d"
Note: if a  = dk, then a = (-d)(-k)
If d > 0 and d|a, then d is a divisor of a.

An integer p > 1 is prime if its only divisors are
1 and p. An integer a > 1 that is not prime is composite.
+-1 are "special". They're the units of the integers, ie. 
they both have a multiplicative inverse.
1*1 = 1
(-1)(-1) = 1

The "Division" or "QR" Theorem
a any ZZ, n a positive integer.
there exists unique integers q and r
with r between 0 and n, such that a = nq + r
q = floor a/n
r = a mod n

Proof: S set of all non-negative integers of the form a-kn, k any ZZ.
The set S is not empty: a=>0, then a-0*n exists in the set S
a < 0, then a-an = a(1-n) exists in the set S

Let r be the smallest element of S.

Then there is some q any ZZ such that r=a-qn, or a=qn+r
Claim r < n; suppose not, then
a-(q+1)n = a-nq-n = r-n >= 0 
r-n<r =><= CONTRADICTION.
Therefore r > n

Define equivalence class modulo of a modulo n:
[a]n = {a + kn: k any ZZ}
Ex: [3]7 = {...,-11,-4,3,10,17,...}

Common Divisors
d|a, d|b the d is a common divisor of a and b.

The greatest common divisor of a and b, gcd(a,b) is the largest common
division of a and b.

Theorem: a,b integers, not both zero, the gcd(a,b)is the smallest positive
element of S = {ax + by; x,y any ZZ}

Proof: Let s is the smallest element of S. Let s = ax + by for some integers
x and y.

Let q= floor(a/s)
a mod s = a - qs
= a-q(ax+by)
= a(1-qx) + by is in S
But a mod s < S and s is the smallest element of S.
Therefore a mod s = 0. Or s|a.
Same argument shows s|b. S is a common division of a,b.
